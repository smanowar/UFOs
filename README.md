# UFO's - Using HTML and JavaScript to Filter UFO Data

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to use HTML, JavaScript, and CSS elements to create a search filter option to filter a dataset of UFO sighting information on specific elements, and present the filtered table in the webpage. 

## Results
Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.

## Summary
In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.

One drawback of this new design is not knowing what options you have to search. Provide a list of possible options to filter for each element. This will allow the user to see what options are even available for them to look for data
 
Recommendations:

1. The ability to filter dates is very specific. Future versions could possibly have the option to filter by year or by month vs. the specific date.
2. Adding a 'clear' button to clear all filters at once. This would allow for a more user friendly experience as if they are filtering more than one element it would allow them to clear everything at once verses deleting the filter for each element manually
